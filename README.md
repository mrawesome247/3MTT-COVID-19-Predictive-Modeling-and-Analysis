### **COVID-19 Predictive Modeling for Public Health**
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a predictive modeling project aimed at analyzing and forecasting COVID-19 trends. 
The project, conducted for HealthGuard Analytics, leverages historical COVID-19 data to generate actionable insights and inform public health policies.

### **Overview**
The project focuses on:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights
- Predictive modeling using time-series analysis and machine learning
- Visualization and interpretation of results
The primary goal is to support better decision-making in public health, particularly for resource allocation and outbreak control.

### **Features**
**Data Preprocessing:**

- Standardized country names and date formats.
- Engineered features like daily growth rates, case fatality rates, and cases per million population.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- Visualized global and country-specific COVID-19 trends.
- Identified correlations between key features.

**Predictive Modeling:**
- Time-series forecasting using ARIMA.
- Machine learning models to predict case fatality rates.

**Key Insights:**
- Exponential growth of cases globally and in Nigeria.
- Strong correlations between population size and COVID-19 case counts.

### **Getting Started**
**Requirements**
- Python 3.8 or later
- Key libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, pmdarima

- **Installation**
 1. clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-predictive-modeling.git
cd covid19-predictive-modeling
2. Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the datasets from [CORD-19 on Kaggle]() and place them in the data/ directory
 
 ### **Usage**
 1. Run the preprocessing notebook (notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb) to clean and prepare the data
 2. Perform EDA using the notebooks/eda.ipynb notebook
 3. Train and evaluate predictive models using notebooks/modeling.ipynb
 4. View visualizations and insights in the visualizations/ folder
 
### **Results**
**Global Insights:**
- Exponential growth of confirmed cases and deaths between February and August 2020.
- Higher case counts in densely populated countries.

**Nigeria-Specific Insights:**
- Over 40,000 confirmed cases by July 2020.
- Case fatality rate of ~2%, with recovery rates nearing 80%

**Models:**
- ARIMA accurately forecasts short-term case trends
- Machine learning models predict case fatality rates with reasonable precision.
